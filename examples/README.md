# Examples

This project is about a library to control the KT0915 device and the focus of this project is the library and its functionalities. __Please, don't ask me to assist you in your: displays, encoders, buttons or something else out the library scope__. Thanks.

The examples purpose is assisting you about the use of the PU2CLR KT0915 Arduino Library.


## KT0915_01_serial_monitor examples 

The examples stored in this folder should be used to check your circuit and check the functionalities implemented by the library. You will not need to use any display device, push buttons and encoders to make a receiver based on KT0916 works. All you will need is your computer and the Arduino IDE to get a basic receiver.

You can use the circuit below to run the sketches stored in the KT0915_01_serial_monitor folder.
