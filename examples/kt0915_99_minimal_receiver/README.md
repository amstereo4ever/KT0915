# Minimal AM/FM receiver

This sketch demonstrates a "minimal' code to build a basic AM and FM receiver based on KT0915. 
This receiver has 4 push buttons and no display device. The push buttons are used to switch AM and FM modes and to tune stations as well. The idea of this example is just to show a way to develop a KT0915 based receiver with Arduino.

The schematic below shows the buttons and Arduino connections
